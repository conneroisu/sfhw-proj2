6. It Depends. Given the above discussion, you should now understand the interaction between
the programs and your hardware designs in terms of performance. Identify or write a program
that performs better on a single-cycle processor versus a hardware-scheduled pipeline and
another one that performs better on the hardware-scheduled pipeline versus the software-
scheduled pipeline. Describe your approach to building these programs. If one of these cases
is impossible given your designs, argue quantitatively why that is the case.
