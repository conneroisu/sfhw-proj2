5. Hardware Optimization. Identify and describe at least one different hardware optimization
for each design that would improve its performance. The optimization cannot be turning it
into one of the other designs. Certain optimizations can be beneficial to more than one design
â€“ chose one design on which you would apply the optimization. Briefly list the specific set of
changes you would have to make to your design to accommodate each optimization (a figure
would be helpful). Provide an estimate of the performance benefit each optimization could
have given your specific benchmarks.
